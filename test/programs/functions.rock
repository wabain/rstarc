    Say X
    Say "y"
    Say Y
    Say "z"
    Say Z
    Say ""
    Say "incrementing within function"
    If Y is mysterious
      Put 0 over 0 into Y

    Build Y up
    Build Z up
    Say "x"
    Say X
    Say "y"
    Say Y
    Say "z"
    Say Z
    Say ""


(
    Expectations:

    X is passed the value 1 as an argument, so it should be updated to
    2 within the function and left untouched outside.

    Y is not passed a value as an argument, so it should be given the
    value mysterious within the function and left untouched outside.

    Z is not a function argument so assigning to it within the function
    should affect the value outside.
